# metaverse.js
Multi Platform VR/AR Framework based off React 360.


Today I read about Zuckerbergs envision of the multiverse. An all in one avatar to engage from social to work (universe to universe). This appears to be already happening in china via social commerce apps with WeChat oAuth. While Facebook anticipates spending billions in research and 3-10 years development with a return of hundreds of Billions. I anticipate using the research from Facebook while slowly overtime taking a fork of React 360 to create MultiVerse.js.
The average engaged user spends 30 mins per day endlessly scrolling. The multiverse plans to be a work and entertainment application with better vr hardware for 8 1/2 hours engagement.
